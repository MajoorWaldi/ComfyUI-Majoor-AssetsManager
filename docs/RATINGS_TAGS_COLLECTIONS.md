# Majoor Assets Manager - Ratings, Tags & Collections Guide

**Version**: 2.3.3  
**Last Updated**: February 28, 2026

## Overview
The Majoor Assets Manager provides powerful organizational tools including ratings, tags, and collections to help you manage and organize your generated assets. This guide covers all features related to asset organization and categorization.

**New in v2.3.3**: Improved bulk operations, better Windows Explorer rating sync, and collection performance optimizations.

## Rating System

### Understanding Ratings
The rating system allows you to assign star ratings from 0 to 5 stars to your assets:
- **0 Stars**: Poor quality or unusable
- **1 Star**: Below average quality
- **2 Stars**: Average quality
- **3 Stars**: Good quality
- **4 Stars**: Very good quality
- **5 Stars**: Excellent quality

### Setting Ratings

#### Via Context Menu
1. Right-click on an asset card
2. Select "Rate" from the context menu
3. Choose the desired star rating (0-5)
4. The rating is saved immediately

#### Via Keyboard Shortcuts
1. Select an asset card
2. Press the corresponding number key (0-5)
3. The rating is applied instantly

#### Via Rating Editor
1. Click on the rating stars directly on the asset card
2. Select the desired number of stars
3. The rating is saved automatically

### Rating Features

#### Bulk Rating
- Select multiple assets using Ctrl/Cmd+click or Shift+click
- Apply the same rating to all selected assets
- Right-click and choose "Rate" to apply to all selections

#### Rating Filters
- Filter assets by minimum rating threshold
- Show only assets rated 3 stars or higher
- Quickly find your best results using rating filters

#### Rating Persistence
- Ratings are stored in the SQLite index database
- Ratings persist between ComfyUI sessions
- Ratings can be synchronized to file metadata (when external tools available)

### Rating Synchronization
When ExifTool is available, ratings can be synced to file metadata:
- Ratings stored in file metadata for portability
- Maintains ratings when files are moved/copied
- Compatible with other applications that read ratings
- Enabled/disabled via settings

#### Windows rating mapping (why 99?)

When sync is enabled, the manager writes both star ratings (0–5) and Windows-style percent fields (`RatingPercent` / `Microsoft:SharedUserRating`) for best Explorer compatibility.

- 0★ → 0
- 1★ → 1
- 2★ → 25
- 3★ → 50
- 4★ → 75
- 5★ → 99 (many Windows handlers treat 99 as “max”)

## Tagging System

### Understanding Tags
Tags are customizable keywords that help categorize and organize your assets:
- Free-form text labels (e.g., "character", "landscape", "fantasy")
- Multiple tags per asset
- Hierarchical tagging support (e.g., "style:anime", "color:warm")
- Searchable across all assets

### Adding Tags

2. Select "Edit Tags" from the context menu
3. Type tags separated by commas or spaces
4. Press Enter to save

#### Via Tags Editor

## Collections System

### Understanding Collections
Collections are user-created groups of assets that can span multiple directories:

- Persistent storage in JSON format
- Shareable between users

### Creating Collections

2. Right-click and choose "Add to Collection"
3. Select an existing collection or create a new one
4. Name your new collection appropriately
5. Assets are added to the collection

#### From Search Results
1. Apply search and filters to find desired assets
2. Select all results (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. Right-click and choose "Add to Collection"
4. Create a new collection for the filtered results

#### Empty Collections
1. Right-click in the Collections tab
2. Choose "Create New Collection"
3. Name your collection
4. Add assets later as needed

### Managing Collections

## Performance Considerations

### Large Collections
